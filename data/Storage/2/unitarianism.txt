Christian Unitarianism is the belief that “The one God is the Father alone, and Jesus is his human Messiah, who is now exalted as Lord and Savior” (UCA, 2024). Proponents of this belief system are in the extreme minority in present day Christianity, but there’s ample reasons to seriously consider their viewpoint. Here are the five best arguments for Christian Unitarianism.
1. The Bible limits Jesus’ capabilities
    • Jesus states that he is unaware of the moment of parousia, and only the Father knows it: “But of that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone” (Matthew 24:36).
    • Jesus was unable to perform certain miracles at Nazareth. According to Mark, “he was not able to perform any mighty deed there, apart from curing a few sick people by laying his hands on them. He was amazed at their lack of faith” (Mark 6:5–6). The approved Catholic footnote clarifies this passage stating, “according to Mark, Jesus’ power could not take effect because of a person’s lack of faith” (Mark 6:5 footnote).
    • Jesus says on multiple occasions that he can do nothing on his own:
“I cannot do anything on my own; I judge as I hear, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me” (John 5:30)
“Amen, amen, I say to you, a son cannot do anything on his own, but only what he sees his father doing; for what he does, his son will do also” (John 5:19)
2. The Bible subordinates Christ to the Father
    • Jesus explicitly states that the Father is greater than him: “You heard me tell you, ‘I am going away and I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I” (John 14:28).
    • When Paul writes of the end times, he explicitly notes that the Son will be subjected to the Father: “then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has destroyed every sovereignty and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death, for ‘he subjected everything under his feet.’ But when it says that everything has been subjected, it is clear that it excludes the one who subjected everything to him. When everything is subjected to him, then the Son himself will [also] be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all” (1 Corinthians 15:24–28).
    • Jesus’ message is the Father’s, not his: “I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and speak. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So what I say, I say as the Father told me” (John 12:49)
    • Jesus received the authority to judge from the Father, he did not possess it on his own: “Nor does the Father judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to his Son…For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to his Son the possession of life in himself. And he gave him power to exercise judgment, because he is the Son of Man” (John 5:22; 26–27)
    • Jesus only has life because of the Father: “Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me” (John 6:57).
    • Jesus is doing the will of the Father, not his own will, which implicitly means they possess different wills: “I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me” (John 6:38).
    • Again Jesus states that what he has was given to him by the Father, he did not possess it on his own: “The Father loves the Son and has given everything over to him” (John 3:35).
3. Early Christians subordinated Jesus to the Father
    • Ignatius, writing around A.D. 100, implores his followers to be obedient to the bishop, just as Jesus is obedient to the Father: “See that you all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God” (Ignatius, n.d., Chapter 8).
    • Tertullian was an early Christian apologist living between A.D. 155–220. In Against Praxes, he wrote, “For the Father is the entire substance, but the Son is a derivation and portion of the whole, as He Himself acknowledges: ‘My Father is greater than I’” (Tertullian, n.d., Chapter 9).
    • Writing around the 200s, Origen of Alexandria was the most prolific writer in Christian antiquity and is still regarded by some scholars as the “greatest scholar of Christian antiquity” (Jurgens, 1979, p. 189). In his work Origen against Celsus, Origen states “For we who say that the visible world is under the government to Him who created all things, do thereby declare that the Son is not mightier than the Father, but inferior to Him” (Origen, 2016, p. 642).
    • In the early 200s, Pope Callistus accused Hippolytus of being a “ditheist” for supporting proto-trinitarian ideas (Easton, 1934, II. Hippolytus).
    • Novatian, a third century priest writing around A.D. 235, wrote “God the Father, founder and creator of all things, who alone knows no beginning, who is invisible, immeasurable, immortal, and eternal, is one God. Neither his greatness nor His majesty nor His power can possibly be — I should not say exceeded, for they cannot even be equalled. From Him, when He willed it, the Word was born, His Son…It is necessary for Him who knows no origin to be antecedent to Him who has an origin” (Jurgens, 1979, p. 248).
4. God’s Necessary Components
    • God is the ultimate being and necessarily must thus possess components which are greater than all other beings. This requires God to have more knowledge, power, authority, etc., than all other beings. If God lacked a necessary aspect of God, then He would not be God. Consequently, God cannot give up his own nature; the Godhood cannot be vacated. Therefore, if Jesus is God, he could not give up his omniscience. Since the gospels are clear that Jesus did lose his omniscience, he could not be the ultimate being equal with the Father.
    • Some scholars, such as Dr. William Lane Craig have argued that Jesus’ limitations in scripture are affirmations of Jesus’ true humanity (ReasonableFaithOrg, in YouTube, 28:10). This defense is similar to the traditional Catholic argument of hypostasis which cannot be rescued logically. In this formulation, “‘there is but one hypostasis which is our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the Trinity.’ Thus everything in Christ’s human nature is to be attributed to his divine person as its proper subject, not only his miracles, but also his sufferings and even his death” (CCC 468, p. 134). Furthermore, the Council of Chalcedon in 451 states, “We confess that one and the same Christ, Lord, and only-begotten Son, is to be acknowledged in two natures without confusion, change, division, or separation. The distinction between the natures was never abolished by their union, but rather the character proper to each of the two natures was preserved as they came together in one person and one hypostasis” (CCC 467, p. 134). This idea that somehow Jesus was one unified person with two natures that were never divided is simply affirming a contradiction. Jesus, as one person, could not both know and not know the hour of parousia. That would require that the divine person was sufficiently separated from his human person. The argument of simultaneous true Godhood and true humanity is illogical.
5. The Logic of Generation
    • At least in Catholicism there is an infallible doctrine of the Father eternally generating the Son, declared at the Council of Florence and translated in the Catechism: “‘since the Father has through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son’” (CCC 246, p. 80). This doctrine cannot be logically reconciled with equality in the Godhead. If the Son depends on the Father for generation, he is not able to exist independently of the Father and is therefore not equal to the one True God.
