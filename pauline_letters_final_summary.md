# Pauline Letters Stylometric Analysis: Final Summary

## Key Findings

1. **Internal Cohesion Varies by Letter Group**
   - The major Pauline letters (Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians) show strong internal similarity (>0.85)
   - The Pastoral Epistles (1 & 2 Timothy, Titus) form another consistent cluster with high internal similarity
   - Philemon consistently appears as an outlier, showing negative similarity with most other letters

2. **Undisputed vs. Disputed Letters**
   - Undisputed Pauline letters show higher internal similarity (0.0636) than disputed letters (0.0358) in the baseline configuration
   - Cross-group similarity is generally negative (-0.1663 in baseline), suggesting stylistic differences between the two groups
   - This pattern is consistent across most weight configurations, with vocabulary-focused analysis showing the largest group separation

3. **Weight Configurations Reveal Different Patterns**
   - **NLP-only**: Shows extreme similarity values (both 1.0 and near -1.0) with high variation
   - **Vocabulary-focused**: Amplifies the differences between letter groups, with the highest positive internal similarity
   - **Structure-focused**: Reveals interesting connections like 1 Corinthians-Galatians that aren't as strong in other configurations
   - **Baseline**: Shows moderate differentiation while preserving some cross-group connections

4. **Letter Clustering**
   - Hierarchical clustering reveals distinct letter groupings that are generally consistent with traditional groupings:
     - Major letters (Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians)
     - Pastoral letters (1 & 2 Timothy, Titus)
     - Prison letters (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians)

## Implications for Authorship Studies

The analysis demonstrates how different aspects of writing style can yield different similarity patterns:

1. **Multiple Features Matter**: No single feature type (vocabulary, sentence structure, etc.) gives a complete picture of authorial style

2. **Authorship Questions Remain Complex**: The data shows both:
   - Evidence supporting traditional classifications (clear separation between major letters and pastorals)
   - Unexpected relationships that complicate simple authorship theories (e.g., high similarity between some undisputed and disputed letters)

3. **Methodological Insights**:
   - Feature weighting dramatically affects perceived similarity
   - Syntactic features alone (NLP-only) produce extreme values that may be less reliable for discrimination
   - Vocabulary features appear to be the strongest discriminators between traditional letter groups

## Conclusion

This stylometric analysis of Pauline letters reveals complex stylistic relationships that vary based on which aspects of writing are emphasized. The most consistent finding is the clear stylistic distinction between the major letters and the Pastoral Epistles, which aligns with scholarly debates about potential differences in authorship.

However, the analysis also shows that different analytical approaches highlight different relationships, and cross-group connections exist that complicate simple authorship theories. This demonstrates why authorship studies benefit from multiple methodological approaches and why stylometric evidence should be considered alongside historical, theological, and contextual factors.
